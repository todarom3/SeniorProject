John Cavanaugh: Project notes  
Week 1: On this week I helped pick the project and make the description and readme  
Week 2: On this week I researched and found websites with real world transaction data, and i created a java file that generates similar fake transaction data that can be used in our project  
Week 3: On this week I created a java file that checks the fake transaction data for common patterns seen in fraudelent transactions and outputs a fraud probability chance for the suspicious ones. I also updated the fake transaction data generator to purposely generate fraudelent data based on those patterns  
Week 4: On this week I got SQLite setup with our project and decided on the format in which data would be stored. I also made a java file that inserts the data from " transactions.csv" into the database. I also did some research on how I will be able to further improve the way we generate and check for fraud in our project.
