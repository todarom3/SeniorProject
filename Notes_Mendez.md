This is my notes for research and updates on my part of the project. 
Fraud detection comes in layers: 
A) The primary model would likely be a random forest classifier, which would act as the predictor and use ML to predict potential fraud. 
B) there is logisitc regression: which is a model that tracks specific transcations as well as info abt said transactions like time, amount, location, etc. 
C) Another model is an isolation forest: which is an unsupervised learning algorithm that can be used to flag suspicious transactions. 
Each of these will more than likely be used, as I do more research i will add it on here. 


2/15/26: began implementation of toy model, as well as creating a test folder with a file that will test the model using the transactions.csv file
- i need help installing python on my system as it is giving me problems.
