Project Title: End-to-End Data Analytics Fraud Detection Platform   

Project Description:  
This project is an end-to-end data analytics platform focused on detecting fraudulent financial transactions. The system ingests transaction data, processes and stores it, applies analysis and machine learning techniques to identify fraudulent behavior, and visualizes the results in a dashboard.  
The goal is to simulate a real-world fraud detection system by building a complete data pipeline rather than working only with isolated scripts or notebooks.

Project Domain:  
The project domain is financial fraud detection. The system primarily uses synthetic transaction data that mimics real-world purchasing behavior. Public datasets may also be referenced for validation and comparison.
High-Level Pipeline
Ingest raw transaction data
Clean and transform the data
Store processed data in a SQL database
Analyze data and detect potential fraud
Visualize results in a dashboard

Technologies Used:  
Java for data ingestion and backend pipeline components  
Python for data analysis and machine learning  
SQL (Postgres or SQLite) for database design and querying  
ETL pipeline for data processing  
REST API for backend communication  
Dashboard tools such as React, Streamlit, or Dash  

Team Workflow:
Person 1: Data generation and ingestion  
Person 2: Database design and fraud detection logic  
Person 3: API development and dashboard visualization  

Project Goal:  
The final system demonstrates how raw data flows through a complete analytics pipeline to produce actionable fraud detection insights, emphasizing real-world data infrastructure over isolated scripts.
