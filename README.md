# SeniorProject  
End-to-End Data Analytics Fraud Detection Platform

Group Members: John Cavanaugh, Matt Todaro, Derek Mendez  

Project Overview:  
This project is an end-to-end data analytics platform focused on detecting fraudulent financial transactions.  
The system ingests transaction data, cleans and stores it in a relational database, applies statistical analysis and machine learning techniques to identify fraudulent behavior, and visualizes the results in a dashboard.  
The goal is to simulate a real-world fraud detection system by building a complete data pipeline rather than relying on isolated scripts or notebooks.  

Project Goal:  
The goal of this project is to design and implement a full data analytics pipeline for fraud detection.  
The system demonstrates how raw transaction data flows through ingestion, storage, analysis, and visualization while reinforcing concepts in software development, databases, and data analysis.  

Project Domain:  
The project domain is financial fraud detection   
The system primarily uses synthetic transaction data designed to mimic real-world purchasing behavior   
Public datasets may be referenced for validation and comparison  

Expected Deliverables:  
A complete data pipeline that ingests and processes transaction data  
A relational SQL database populated with cleaned transaction data  
Fraud detection logic using statistical analysis and or machine learning  
A dashboard visualizing fraud trends and flagged transactions  
A GitHub repository containing all source code and documentation  
A final report/presentation explaining system design and results  
High-Level Pipeline
Ingest raw transaction data
Clean and transform the data
Store processed data in a SQL database
Analyze data and detect potential fraud
Visualize results in a dashboard

Technologies Used:  
Java for data ingestion and backend pipeline components  
Python for data analysis and machine learning  
SQL using Postgres or SQLite for database design and querying  
ETL pipeline for data processing  
REST API for backend communication  
Dashboard tools such as React, Streamlit, or Dash  

Motivation:  
The motivation for this project comes from our interest in building a system that combines skills we have already learned with new, practical technologies.
We wanted to apply our knowledge of Java and SQL in a realistic project while also learning useful skills in Python, data analysis, and machine learning.
Fraud detection is a relevant real-world problem that provides insight into how modern data pipelines and analytics systems are used in industry.

Project Timeline:  
The project follows a structured 15-week timeline covering planning, data ingestion, analysis, model development, system integration, and final presentation.  
Each phase builds toward a fully integrated end-to-end fraud detection platform.
