An end-to-end data analytics platform that ingests transaction data, detects fraudulent behavior using analysis and machine learning, and visualizes results in a dashboard.
End-to-End Data Analytics Fraud Detection Platform
Overview

This project is an end-to-end data analytics platform focused on detecting fraudulent financial transactions. The goal is to simulate a real-world fraud detection system by building a full pipeline from data ingestion to analysis and visualization.

Project Domain

The project domain is financial fraud detection. We primarily use synthetic transaction data that mimics real-world purchasing behavior, with optional reference to public datasets for validation and comparison.

High-Level Pipeline

Ingest raw transaction data

Clean and transform the data

Store data in a SQL database

Analyze data and detect potential fraud

Visualize results in a dashboard

Technologies Used

Java for data ingestion and backend pipeline components

Python for data analysis and machine learning

SQL (Postgres or SQLite) for database design and querying

ETL pipeline for data processing

REST API for backend communication

Dashboard tools such as React, Streamlit, or Dash

Team Workflow

Person 1: Data generation and ingestion

Person 2: Database design and fraud detection logic

Person 3: API development and dashboard visualization

Goal

The final system demonstrates how raw data flows through a complete analytics pipeline to produce actionable fraud detection insights, emphasizing real-world data infrastructure over isolated scripts.
