(Old basic dashboard removed)
This week, I wanted to get github desktop and eclipse connected to this project, but I was having trouble so I will need to keep working on that.
I was able to get a basic Dashboard set up using John's files, however I must change the design in the future. My goal is to make it pleasing to look at, hold more data, contains charts, and more. 

2/10 - 2/17:
This week, I researched vuejs and react to come up with a design for the dashboard. I wanted to see what these websites had to offer, and they gave me a much better understanding on what I need to do in order to design a productive dashboard. I plan on coming up with a base model for the dashboard in the upcoming weeks.

2/17 – 2/22:
This week, I significantly expanded the functionality of the Fraud Detection Dashboard. I implemented full transaction pagination, ensuring that all transactions from the dataset are displayed in descending order by timestamp. The most recent transactions now appear first, with older transactions accessible through page navigation controls.
I also improved the user interface and formatting of the transaction table. Additionally, I added summary analytics.
Finally, I deployed the React (Vite) frontend using Vercel, making the dashboard publicly accessible.

Live Dashboard Deployment:

This deployment marks the first fully functional, publicly accessible version of the Fraud Detection Dashboard.
