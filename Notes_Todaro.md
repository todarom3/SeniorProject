Link to Dashboard: https://todarom3.github.io/SeniorProject/dashboard/index.html

This week, I wanted to get github desktop and eclipse connected to this project, but I was having trouble so I will need to keep working on that.
I was able to get a basic Dashboard set up using John's files, however I must change the design in the future. My goal is to make it pleasing to look at, hold more data, contains charts, and more.
